# Move-with-arrow-keys
This is basically an object(can be anything according to our choice) which can be moved in a particular canvas of specified width and height with the help of arrow keys.
I could have given separate files for each css,html and javascript ,but decided to do it in a single one.
Hope everyone likes it.:)
